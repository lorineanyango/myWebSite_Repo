The Event Management System was designed with a clean, intuitive layout to ensure easy navigation. A modern color scheme was chosen for a professional and visually appealing look, while responsive design principles were applied to make the platform accessible on all devices.

JavaScript was used to enhance interactivity. Form validation ensures users enter valid details before submitting event registrations or login credentials. A real-time search feature allows users to quickly find events by name or category. Additionally, an event countdown timer dynamically updates, creating urgency and engagement.

During development, one major challenge was ensuring responsiveness across different screen sizes. This was addressed using CSS Flexbox and media queries. Another challenge was efficient state management for real-time search and dynamic UI updates, which was resolved through optimized DOM manipulation and event listeners.

For deployment, the frontend was hosted on GitHub Pages, while the backend (Node.js and MySQL) was deployed on Railway.app. The process involved local testing, debugging, and version control using Git to ensure a smooth deployment.

This project provides a simple yet powerful platform for managing and discovering events, integrating essential features to enhance user experience.
